          "This work is primarily based on an exclusive interview with a talented artist and key founder of the Liwu Workshop, Chen Wen Li, talking about an idea of bringing Western contemporary art into her growing aboriginal community, and observed how residents had instantly transformed their role from a watcher into a creator. After nine months of follow-up, we had much interaction with the residents and heard a wide range of opinions, so we reorganized the interview content and published it as a book. To allow more people to read this book without geographical restrictions, I designed and wrote the website built on top of the React library and It took ten days from framing to fulfillment and went live in May 2017. The website uses the word 'Li' (it can mean establishing something in Chinese) to adopt a simple, stable and neat design idea, and uses black and white as the main color tone. Without overmuch visual interference, it focuses on telling the story of the six interviewees.",
